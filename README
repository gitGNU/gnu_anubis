 Introduction
 ============

 GNU Anubis is an outgoing mail processor. It goes between the MUA (Mail User
 Agent) and the MTA (Mail Transport Agent), and can perform on the fly various
 sorts of processing and conversion on the outgoing mail in accord with the
 sender's specified rules, based on a highly configurable regular expressions
 system. It operates as a proxy server, independently from mail user agents.
 GNU Anubis can edit outgoing mail headers, encrypt and/or sign mail with the
 GNU Privacy Guard, build secure SMTP tunnels (Simple Mail Transport Protocol)
 using the TLS/SSL encryption even if your mail user agent doesn't support it,
 or tunnel a connection through a SOCKS proxy server.

 SUPPORTED SOFTWARE
 ==================

 Required:

 * The TCP/IP Identification Protocol (RFC 1413) server (any).

 Highly recommended:

 * GnuTLS -- a Transport Layer Security Library (http://www.gnutls.org/)
   or OpenSSL -- a cryptographic package (http://www.openssl.org/).
 * GnuPG -- The GNU Privacy Guard (http://www.gnupg.org/)
   with GPGME -- GnuPG Made Easy (http://www.gnupg.org/gpgme.html).
 * Guile -- The GNU extension language (http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/).

 Optional:

 * PCRE -- Perl-Compatible Regular Expression Library (http://www.pcre.org/).
 * PAM -- Pluggable Authentication Modules.
 * libwrap (TCP wrappers) -- an access control library.


 INSTALLATION
 ============

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ make install

 By default, GNU Anubis will be installed in `/usr/local/sbin/anubis',
 but this can be changed with the `--prefix' command, for instance:

 $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
 $ make
 $ make install

 For better control, use the options below.
 Set the `./configure' script with:

 `--with-pcre'         to support Perl-compatible regular expressions.
 `--with-pam'          to support Pluggable Authentication Modules.
 `--with-tcp-wrappers' to support libwrap (TCP wrappers).
 `--with-openssl'      to support OpenSSL (and disable GnuTLS).
 `--without-gnutls'    to disable GnuTLS support.
 `--without-gpgme'     to disable GNU Privacy Guard (GPGME) support.
 `--without-guile'     to disable Guile support.
 `--with-unprivileged-user=USER'
                       to set an unprivileged user (default is "nobody").

 Next, write a proper init script for your system. See the examples
 in the `scripts' directory (part of the distribution).

 NOTE: Remember about activating GNU Anubis with `ntsysv' tool
 or similar, and configure its system configuration file (read
 the GNU Anubis Manual about this topic).

 CAUTION: It is required to install the TCP/IP IDENT protocol
 server (RFC 1413). Without it, an outgoing mail processor will fail.
 Most modern GNU/Linux (or *BSD) distributions have already installed
 such a server. If not, try `pidentd', available at:
 ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/ident/servers/

 Editing Configuration Files with GNU Emacs
 ==========================================

 The file elisp/anubis-mode.el provides the Emacs major mode for
 editing Anubis configuration files.

 After `make install' Emacs should be able to use anubis-mode
 when editing appropriate configuration files. You will
 have to add the following to your .emacs or site-start file:

 (autoload 'anubis-mode "Anubis-Config")
 (setq auto-mode-alist (append auto-mode-alist
                                '(("/.anubisrc$" . anubis-mode)
                                  ("/anubisrc$" . anubis-mode))))

 You may also wish to modify the following variables:

 * anubis-section-body-indent

 Sets the indentation level for a section body. Defaults to 0.

 * anubis-level-indent

 Sets amount of indentation per block nesting level. Defaults to 2.
