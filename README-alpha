This is the GNU Anubis package.

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production
use yet. If you are taking source from CVS, you will need to
have autoconf, automake, yacc*, lex**, and gettext installed
to help contribute. The script `autogen.sh' is provided to help
autoconfigure Anubis from the CVS src. After you run `autogen.sh',
there should be a file `INSTALL' with (generic) installation
instructions.

To get this information from CVS issue the following commands:

 cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/anubis login

Press enter when prompted for a password.

 cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/anubis checkout anubis

This will give you read-only access. If you think you need write access,
contact the mailing list.

In order to build this you will need to call the auto* tools with
the right arguments, see or run the `autogen.sh'.
