 TO DO
 =====

* anubisusr.c: Provide (configuration file||command line||envar) options
to hold authentication credentials. Turn off echo when asking for
security-sensitive info.

* New action commands
** `reject' action command

* Parser and run-time evaluator:
** Add more verbose diagnostics to the parser. More specifically, emit
a warning if gpg-crypt, rot-13 and the like may be used twice over the
same block of text. (Basically this means adding a rudimentary flow
control analyzer).

* New features
** OpenPGP/MIME support
** S/MIME support
** MIME handling: adding, removing, etc.
** RFC 2017 support (requires above)

* Tunnel core
** HTML processing (also removing HTML part)
** IPv6 support
** Error notification system (via email)

* Other stuff
** An external performance test.

* Minor issues
** Fix diagnostic messages to conform to standards texi: replace contracted
verbal forms with full ones, check the proper use of 'illegal' and 'path'.
