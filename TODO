 TO DO
 =====

* Update documentation and examples to reflect the new syntax and
semantics of the anubis language.

* Tunnel core
** HTML processing (also removing HTML part)
** IPv6 support

** Rewrite process_command and transfer_command to make them modular.

* Parser and run-time evaluator:
** Add support for `modify body ["pattern"] "replace"'
** Add more verbose diagnostics to the parser. More specifically, emit
a warning if gpg-crypt, rot-13 and the like may be used twice over the
same block of text. (Basically this means adding a rudimentary flow
control analyzer).

* New features
** OpenPGP/MIME support
** S/MIME support
** `reject' action command
