 TO DO
 =====

* Update documentation and examples to reflect the new syntax and
semantics of the anubis language.

* New settings (system configuration file)
** `settings-priority = system | user'
** `drop-unknown-client = yes | no'
** `forbid-user-settings = yes | no'

* New action commands
** `reject' action command

* Parser and run-time evaluator:
** Allow RULE section in the system configuration file.
** Add more verbose diagnostics to the parser. More specifically, emit
a warning if gpg-crypt, rot-13 and the like may be used twice over the
same block of text. (Basically this means adding a rudimentary flow
control analyzer).

* New features
** OpenPGP/MIME support
** S/MIME support

* Tunnel core
** HTML processing (also removing HTML part)
** IPv6 support

* Other stuff
** An external performance test.
** anubis-mode.el -- a major mode for editing
system/user configuration files.
