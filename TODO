 TO DO
 =====

* Update documentation and examples to reflect the new syntax and
semantics of the anubis language.

* Tunnel core
** HTML processing
** IPv6 support

** Store the message body as a list of "line instructions" instead of one
text blurb. A "line instruction" is one of the following:
*** Simple text.
Carries a single text line.
*** File reference.
Carries a name of the file that must be inserted in this point
*** Maybe something else?

** Rewrite transfer_body to make use of the above.

** Add back the support for remailers.

** Rewrite process_command and transfer_command to make them modular.

* Parser and run-time evaluator:
** Add support for `modify body ["pattern"] "replace"'
** Add more verbose diagnostics to the parser. More specifically, emit
a warning if gpg-crypt, rot-13 and the like may be used twice over the
same block of text. (Basically this means adding a rudimentary flow
control analyzer).
** Add support for "stop" instruction -- immediately stop the processing
of the section.
** Add support for "call" instruction" -- call a named section (kind of
a subroutine).
