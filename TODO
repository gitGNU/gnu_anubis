GNU Anubis TODO list. 2005-05-25
Copyright (C) 2003-2014 The Anubis Team

* Urgent: 

** Get rid of global vs. local variable mess. 

** Write general-purpose (e)smtp io functions and use them throughout
the code (take anubisusr.c as an example)

** Remove duplicated functions: place them all into a library

** Do we need session.execpath at all? I guess we don't... 
 
* anubisusr.c: Provide (configuration file||command line||envar) options
to hold authentication credentials.

* New action commands
** `reject' action command

* Parser and run-time evaluator:
** Add more verbose diagnostics to the parser. More specifically, emit
a warning if gpg-crypt, rot-13 and the like may be used twice over the
same block of text. (Basically this means adding a rudimentary flow
control analyzer).

* The Core
** RFC 3463 compatible.
** Error notification system (via email)
** HTML processing (also removing HTML part)
** IPv6 support

* New features
** OpenPGP/MIME support (high priority)
** S/MIME support (via new GnuPG 2.x and GPGME)
** MIME handling: adding, removing, etc.
** RFC 2017 support (requires above)

* Other stuff
** a guile plugin to test message(s) with an anti-spam
and/or anti-virus software.
** An external performance test.

* Minor issues
