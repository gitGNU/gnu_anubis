 TO DO
 =====

* New action commands
** `reject' action command

* Parser and run-time evaluator:
** Add more verbose diagnostics to the parser. More specifically, emit
a warning if gpg-crypt, rot-13 and the like may be used twice over the
same block of text. (Basically this means adding a rudimentary flow
control analyzer).

* New features
** OpenPGP/MIME support
** S/MIME support

* Tunnel core
** HTML processing (also removing HTML part)
** IPv6 support

* Other stuff
** An external performance test.
** anubis-mode.el -- a major mode for editing
system/user configuration files.
