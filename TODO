 TO DO
 =====

* anubisusr.c: Provide (configuration file||command line||envar) options
to hold authentication credentials. Turn off echo when asking for
security-sensitive info.

* New action commands
** `reject' action command

* Parser and run-time evaluator:
** Add more verbose diagnostics to the parser. More specifically, emit
a warning if gpg-crypt, rot-13 and the like may be used twice over the
same block of text. (Basically this means adding a rudimentary flow
control analyzer).

* The Core
** RFC 3463 compatible.
** Error notification system (via email)
** HTML processing (also removing HTML part)
** IPv6 support

* New features
** OpenPGP/MIME support (high priority)
** S/MIME support (via new GnuPG 2.x and GPGME)
** MIME handling: adding, removing, etc.
** RFC 2017 support (requires above)

* Other stuff
** a guile plugin to test message(s) with an anti-spam
and/or anti-virus software.
** An external performance test.

* Minor issues
** Fix diagnostic messages to conform to standards texi: replace contracted
verbal forms with full ones, check the proper use of 'illegal' and 'path'.
